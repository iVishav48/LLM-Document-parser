📑 LLM-Document-Parser

AI-powered document parsing and Q&A system that extracts, understands, and delivers precise answers from your documents — with citations and zero hallucinations.


🚀 Why LLM-Document-Parser?

In enterprises today, 80% of data lives in unstructured documents (contracts, reports, policies). Generic LLMs hallucinate when asked about such documents, wasting hours and risking compliance errors.
LLM-Document-Parser solves this by combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a modular, scalable backend:
Grounded Answers: Only uses your documents as the knowledge base.
Citations Included: Every answer links back to source document/page/clause.
API-First Design: Plug into CRMs, dashboards, and compliance tools.
Scalable Architecture: Bun + TypeScript backend + Python core worker + Vector DB.


✨ Features

✅ Multi-domain support – Legal, research, compliance, customer support
✅ Document ingestion pipeline – OCR, chunking, metadata tagging
✅ Smart retrieval – Embeddings + vector DB + relevance filters
✅ Grounded Q&A – Context-aware answers with citations
✅ API endpoints – Seamless integration into enterprise tools
✅ Customizable prompts – Domain-aware tone & safe fallback behavior
✅ Enterprise-ready – On-prem/cloud deployment, encryption, logs
