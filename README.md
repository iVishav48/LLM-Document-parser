# 🧠 LLM-Document-Parser

### Transforming documents into intelligent, searchable knowledge.

---

## 📌 Overview

**LLM-Document-Parser** is an AI-powered system designed to make document understanding faster, smarter, and more accurate.  
By combining the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, it enables users to extract, summarize, and query information from long and complex documents — all through natural language queries.

Whether you're a **lawyer** analyzing 200-page contracts, a **researcher** reviewing academic papers, or a **compliance officer** scanning company policies, LLM-Document-Parser helps you find answers in seconds — not hours.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔍 Semantic Document Search:**  
  Ask natural-language questions and get precise, context-aware answers directly from your documents.

- **🧩 RAG-Based Architecture:**  
  Combines retrieval and generation to ensure factual, grounded responses — no hallucinations.

- **⚙️ Modular System Design:**  
  - **Backend API (TypeScript + Bun):** Fast, lightweight, and scalable API for handling user queries and orchestration.  
  - **Core Worker (Python):** Handles heavy lifting like document chunking, embeddings generation, and LLM integration.

- **📚 Multi-Format Support:**  
  Supports PDFs, Word files, text documents, and scanned documents (via OCR).

- **⚡ High Performance & Scalability:**  
  Built using **Bun** for rapid startup and low-latency processing; can handle multiple concurrent users efficiently.

- **🧠 Context-Aware Responses:**  
  If an answer isn’t in the document, the system clearly communicates that — ensuring trust and transparency.

- **💾 Vector Database Integration:**  
  Uses embeddings-based semantic search for meaningful context retrieval.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **🎙️ Audio Integration:**  
  Add *speech-to-text (Whisper)* to parse and query meeting recordings or podcasts.

- **🎥 Video Understanding:**  
  Implement *video summarization* and *transcript-based retrieval* for lecture or training content.

- **🌍 Multilingual Support:**  
  Enable document parsing and query answering across multiple languages.

- **📊 Analytics Dashboard:**  
  Provide document insights, summaries, and semantic similarity maps for enterprise users.

- **🧩 Plug-in Ecosystem:**  
  Allow developers to extend the parser with custom LLMs, vector databases, or domain-specific modules.
